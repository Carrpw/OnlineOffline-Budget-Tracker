  ## Description

  I started this project by creating a heroku for it, linking the github repo to heroku, and linking that to a mongodb. Once that was created I went into the server.js file and added the MONGODB_URI to it along with an alternate port if the local 3000 was unavailiblel. I then added the db.js file that was given by the instructor due to time constraints. Next I made a manifest.webmanifest file that had both of the icons that were given in it and added a link the the file in the index.html. The next file I made was the service-worker.js and the files I precached were all the files in the public folder. Once those were listed I made the install function, activate function, and fetch function which, is vital to caching the infortion so that if the application is offline it can pull from the cache.
